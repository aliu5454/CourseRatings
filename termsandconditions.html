                https://courseratings.ca website (the “Service”) operated by Course Ratings (“us”, “we”, or “our”). <br> <br>
                Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these
                Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users and others who access or use the Service. <br> <br>
                By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of
                the terms then you may not access the Service. <br> <br>
                The Service and its original content, features and functionality are and will remain the exclusive
                property of Course Ratings and its licensors. <br> <br>
                Our Service may contain links to third-party web sites or services that are not owned or controlled by
                Course Ratings. <br> <br>
                Course Ratings has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or
                practices of any third party web sites or services. You further acknowledge and agree that Course
                Ratings shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or
                alleged to be caused by or in connection with use of or reliance on any such content, goods or services
                available on or through any such web sites or services. <br> <br>
                We strongly advise you to read the terms and conditions and privacy policies of any third-party web sites
                or services that you visit. <br> <br>
                We may terminate or suspend access to our Service immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any
                reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach the Terms.<br> <br>
                We may terminate or suspend access to our Service immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any
                reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach the Terms.<br> <br>
                All provisions of the Terms which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination,
                including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of
                liability.<br> <br>
                Your use of the Service is at your sole risk. The Service is provided on an “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE”
                basis. The Service is provided without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including,
                but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose,
                non-infringement or course of performance.<br> <br>
                These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of Canada without regard to its
                conflict of law provisions.<br> <br>
                Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those
                rights. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining
                provisions of these Terms will remain in effect. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between us
                regarding our Service, and supersede and replace any prior agreements we might have between us regarding
                the Service.<br> <br>
                We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision
                is material we will try to provide at least 30 days notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What
                constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion.<br> <br>
                By continuing to access or use our Service after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound
                by the revised terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, please stop using the Service.<br> <br>
                If you have any questions about these Terms, please contact us.</p>
