                <h2>About Us</h2>
                <p>We're UBC students, just like you.</p>
            </header>

            <a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/ubcphoto.jpg" alt="" /></a>
            <p>After 4 years of researching blogs, asking classmates and friends, and looking through course
                websites only to find limited information on courses, we decided that it’s time there should be
                a platform to allow students to review, rate, and see other student’s experiences with courses.
                We also thought that having grade distributions and other essential course information alongside reviews 
                could tremedously benefit students looking for courses that fit their needs.
                With courseratings.ca, we’ve made this happen.</p>
            <p>We believe this can aid students in the research of classes they're interested in and that these
                reviews
                can serve as a platform for quality, original, and trustworthy first person course reviews.</p>
            <p>Sincerely, <br> Andrew Liu and Toorjo Mishra</p>

            <p>This project wouldn't have been possible without the hard work and open source projects made available by other
